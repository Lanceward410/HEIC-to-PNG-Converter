I created my own HEIC to PNG converter, and perhaps you should too.
I found myself converting from HEIC to PNG nearly every single day.
The converters I was using were fine, but sometimes I was converting documents so sensitive that I began to wonder...
Who was on the other side of the website that my HEIC is being saved to and processed by?
Now I sleep well at night knowing full well the answer to that question.

You won't be able to use mine, as my free Amazon bucket would likely not be free anymore if you did,
but you can certainly use it to help model your own if you'd like, with your own free Amazon bucket.
